###Benjamin Gamble, Cheryln Barber, Kay Krewson

Workout Blender is a CRUD / SPA that allows the user to do things that currently-available fitness trackers are not geared toward seeing a detailed breakdown of existing workouts.

* See the exercise breakdowns for various commercially-available workouts

* Save

* Search through the workout breakdowns to find workouts that use a particular piece of equipment or involve a particular exercise (i.e. 'show me all workouts that use a stability ball')

* For workouts that have "premixes" - proscribed subsets of the full workout - the user will be able to choose to see only those exercises that are contained in that premix

* Enter the data from their HRM to see how their body has responded to a given workout over time
